@description
This script is a stress test for the modular arithmetic utility functions.
It validates the correctness of `power`, `extended_gcd`, and `mod_inverse`
by comparing their results against known properties and Python's built-in
functions over a large number of randomized inputs.

The test covers:
1. `power(base, exp, mod)`: Compared against Python's built-in `pow(base, exp, mod)`.
2. `extended_gcd(a, b)`: Verifies that the returned `g`, `x`, `y` satisfy the
   BÃ©zout's identity `a*x + b*y = g` and that `g` is indeed `gcd(a, b)`.
3. `mod_inverse(a, m)`: Verifies that if an inverse `inv_a` is found, the
   property `(a * inv_a) % m == 1` holds. It also checks that an inverse is
   only found when `gcd(a, m) == 1`.
