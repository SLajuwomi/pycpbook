# PyCPBook Documentation Standards

## Mandatory Docstring Format
Every `.py` file in `content/` MUST begin with a docstring containing only educational content:

```python
"""
[Step-by-step explanation of the algorithm. This can be multiple paragraphs long and should be detailed enough for someone to learn the concept from scratch. It should explain the 'why' behind the code. Include time and space complexity information inline where relevant.]

Additional paragraphs can explain:
- Implementation details and edge cases
- Trade-offs and alternative approaches
- Context for when to use each algorithm
- Common pitfalls and how to avoid them
"""
```

## LaTeX Math Formatting
- Use `$...$` delimiters for math expressions
- Escape backslashes: `$O(\\\\log N)$` not `$O(\\log N)$`
- Use backticks for inline code: `` `solve()` `` function uses `` `sys.stdin.readline()` ``
- For literal backslashes in code, use double backslash: `` `\\\\n` ``

## Description Quality Requirements
- Explanations must be comprehensive and clear
- Break down algorithms step-by-step
- Assume user is intelligent but unfamiliar with the specific topic
- Include the "why" behind algorithmic choices
- Cover edge cases and implementation details
- Educational value: Code should serve as both reference and learning resource
- Provide context for when to use each algorithm
- Explain trade-offs and alternative approaches where relevant

## Example Reference
See [content/fundamentals/python_idioms.py](mdc:content/fundamentals/python_idioms.py) for proper docstring format.
