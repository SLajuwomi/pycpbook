# PyCPBook LaTeX Integration

## Build System Integration
- All content must be compatible with the existing [build.py](mdc:build.py) script
- Files must be parseable by the `ast` module for docstring extraction
- Generated LaTeX files must compile without errors
- No modifications to build system without explicit approval

## LaTeX File Structure
- Main document: [content/pycpbook.tex](mdc:content/pycpbook.tex)
- Chapter files: [content/{chapter}/chapter.tex](mdc:content/{chapter}/chapter.tex)
- Style files: [doc/tex/pycpbook.sty](mdc:doc/tex/pycpbook.sty) and [doc/tex/preamble.tex](mdc:doc/tex/preamble.tex)

## Generated File Management
- Build script generates `_generated_{filename}.tex` files automatically
- Chapter files should include generated content via `\input{_generated_*.tex}`
- Generated files are temporary and cleaned up by `python build.py clean`

## PDF Generation Requirements
- All new content must compile to PDF without LaTeX errors
- Maintain consistent formatting and layout
- Ensure table of contents updates correctly
- Preserve syntax highlighting for code blocks

## Integration Requirements
- New content must integrate seamlessly with existing chapters
- Update chapter.tex files to include new content
- Ensure PDF generation works without errors
- Maintain consistent formatting and layout

## Build Commands
- `python build.py pdf` - Generate PDF from all content
- `python build.py test` - Run all stress tests
- `python build.py clean` - Remove temporary files and PDF
